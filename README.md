# Face Detection and Tracking In Real Time Video Stream


Now a days, Surveillance Cameras are used everywhere from home to public and
commercial places mainly for purposes like security and monitoring. This project is an
application for automatic face detection and tracking in Real Time Video streams from
surveillance cameras. The work has been done with web cameras in Open Source
platform of 32 bit OpenCV2.4.13 with Python 2.7.8 on 64 bit Windows7. The
algorithm uses Haar Feature based Cascade Classifier to extract Haar like features
developed from the algorithm proposed by Viola-Jones. Here, the purpose is to count
the attendance of students in regular classroom and in examination hall as well as to
identify the person present in the video and to decide whether the person belongs to the
database or not. The project developed here also shows the details of the person
present in video from surveillance camera. We generated the database using the
advanced version of mysql that is sqlite3.1.1. This project can be extended for smart
screen.
